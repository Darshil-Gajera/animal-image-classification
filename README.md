# 🐾 Animal Image Classification with Deep Learning  

This project demonstrates how to classify **animal images** into multiple categories using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow & Keras**.  
The model is trained to recognize animals like **dog, cat, elephant, horse, butterfly, chicken, cow, sheep, and squirrel** 🧠📸

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 Built using **Deep Learning (CNNs)**  
- 📊 Trained on a dataset of multiple animal categories  
- 🖼️ Predicts custom images (upload your own animal photo!)  
- ⚡ Easy to run and extend with more classes  
- 🔮 Ready for future deployment (FastAPI / Streamlit)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of folders, one for each animal category:<br>
dataset/<br>
├── cane (dog)<br>
├── cavallo (horse)<br>
├── elefante (elephant)<br>
├── farfalla (butterfly)<br>
├── gallina (chicken)<br>
├── gatto (cat)<br>
├── mucca (cow)<br>
├── pecora (sheep)<br>
├── ragno (spider)<br>
└── scoiattolo (squirrel)<br>


> 📝 Note: Labels are in Italian (from original dataset) but mapped to English in predictions.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository :
git clone https ://github.com/YourUsername/animal-image-classification.git<br>
cd animal-image-classification
<br>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
## 📊 Results
- Model trained with high accuracy on 9 classes
- Works on unseen images
- Can be improved with Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, etc.)

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add more animal categories
- Train with larger datasets
- Deploy as a Web App with Streamlit or FastAPI
